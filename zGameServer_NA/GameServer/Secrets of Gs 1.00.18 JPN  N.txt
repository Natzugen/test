while i was searching on files, i noted an specially way of compilation
 that i was unable to understand, it was simply wrong, unless there were
 somthing hidden, fortunately the pdb, and the 'lost pointers' give me 
an answer

Here is a List of 'Uncompiled' Files

TPkSystem.cpp (only on 99.60T)
GameEvent.cpp
CCastleEventItemList.cpp
ChaosCastleSetItemDrop.cpp ( this workd with the 'unused' txt file )
and XXXMacro.cpp

all of them seems to be a helper files, there are more but the location
 is even harder, i could emulate one macro.cpp file, SetItemMacro.cpp, 
so with a command you can create a Set Item, interesting functions for
 a GM

LAter i will post some sources that can be implemented on a Dll, of 
course independent of the Header files, since you sometimes get angry
 of not posting h files.

Also there are lost functions there is one gObjSometimeClose (4d9c90 )
 that can be called for example in Characters that aren't sending packets,
